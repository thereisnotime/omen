## Overview

OMEN provides three integrated security components that can be used independently or together:

1. **LSHC** - Linux Security Hardening Configurator
2. **SAMS** - Suspicious Activity Monitoring System
3. **SSHMFA** - SSH MFA Hardening with OTP

Each component is designed to address specific security concerns while maintaining ease of use and flexibility.

## Features

- üéØ **Modular Design** - Use components independently or as a complete suite
- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive TUI** - Beautiful terminal interface using Rich library
- üîß **CLI Support** - Full command-line interface for automation
- üìä **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Real-time security event detection
- üîí **Industry Standards** - Based on CIS, STIG, and security best practices
- üì± **Multi-Platform Alerts** - Slack, Mattermost, Telegram, and custom webhooks
- üîê **Secure by Design** - Proper access controls, auditing, and fail-safes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or newer
- Python 3.10+
- Root/sudo access

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thereisnotime/omen.git
cd omen

# Run the installer
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer will guide you through installing OMEN and its components.

### Usage

Launch the interactive TUI:

```bash
sudo omen
```

Or use CLI commands:

```bash
# Show status of all components
sudo omen status

# Install a specific component
sudo omen install lshc

# Install all components
sudo omen install all
```

## Components

### LSHC - Linux Security Hardening Configurator

Automated security hardening using Ansible playbooks.

**Features:**

- SSH hardening (disable root login, enforce key auth, strong ciphers)
- Firewall configuration (UFW with sensible defaults)
- Password policies (aging, complexity requirements)
- Kernel hardening (sysctl tuning for security)
- Audit framework (auditd with comprehensive rules)

**Quick usage:**

```bash
cd /opt/omen/lshc
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

[üìñ Full LSHC Documentation](lshc/README.md)

### SAMS - Suspicious Activity Monitoring System

Real-time security event detection and alerting.

**Detects:**

- Authentication failures and brute force attempts
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Suspicious command execution
- Critical file modifications
- Network anomalies

**Alerts via:**

- Slack, Mattermost, Telegram
- Custom webhooks with templates
- Structured JSON logs for SIEM integration

**Quick usage:**

```bash
# Configure alerting
sudo nano /opt/omen/sams/config.json

# Start monitoring
sudo systemctl start omen-sams
sudo systemctl enable omen-sams
```

### SSHMFA - SSH MFA Hardening with OTP

SSH two-factor authentication with secure bypass mechanism.

**Features:**

- OTP authentication using Google Authenticator
- User enrollment management
- Temporary admin bypass with audit logging
- Secure group-based access control
- Emergency recovery procedures

**Quick usage:**

```bash
# Enroll a user
sudo python3 /opt/omen/sshmfa/sshmfa.py enroll username

# Grant temporary bypass
sudo python3 /opt/omen/sshmfa/sshmfa.py bypass-grant username

# Enable 2FA system-wide
sudo /opt/omen/sshmfa/scripts/enable-2fa.sh
```

## Configuration

### OMEN System Configuration

Configuration and state tracking:

- Status: `/etc/omen/status.json`
- Logs: `/var/log/omen/`
- Backups: `/var/backups/omen/`

### Component Configuration

Each component has its own configuration:

- LSHC: `/opt/omen/lshc/roles/omen-hardening/defaults/main.yml`
- SAMS: `/opt/omen/sams/config.json`
- SSHMFA: PAM and sshd_config modifications

## Testing

A Vagrant-based test environment is provided:

```bash
cd test
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

[üìñ Test Environment Documentation](test/README.md)

## Security Considerations

### Important Notes

- **SSHMFA**: Always enroll at least one user before enabling 2FA system-wide
- **LSHC**: Review hardening rules before applying to production
- **SAMS**: Configure appropriate alert thresholds to avoid alert fatigue
- **Backups**: All components create backups before modifying system files

### Security Features

- All bypass mechanisms are audited via syslog
- Sensitive operations require root or specific group membership
- File modifications are backed up automatically
- Rate limiting on alerts to prevent storms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Installation fails:**

- Ensure you're running Ubuntu 22.04+
- Check Python version: `python3 --version`
- Run as root: `sudo ./install.sh`

**SAMS not detecting events:**

- Check service status: `systemctl status omen-sams`
- Review logs: `journalctl -u omen-sams -f`
- Verify auditd is running: `systemctl status auditd`

**SSH 2FA lockout:**

- Use bypass mechanism from console
- Restore from backup: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.pre-omen-2fa`
